I used VS CODE and Xaamp for this project.

Sure! To set up and run the Java web application using VS Code, follow these steps:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

If you don't have Java installed, download and install the latest JDK from Oracle's website or OpenJDK distribution.
Install Apache Tomcat:

Download the latest version of Apache Tomcat from the official website (https://tomcat.apache.org/).
Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice. This directory will be referred to as TOMCAT_HOME.
Install Visual Studio Code:

If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, download and install it from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install Required Extensions in VS Code:

Open VS Code and install the following extensions:
"Java Extension Pack" by Microsoft (provides Java language support)
"Tomcat for Java" by Microsoft (integrates Apache Tomcat with VS Code)
Create a New Java Project in VS Code:

Create a new folder for your Java web application project.
Open the folder in VS Code.
Place the Files:

Place the index.html, styles.css, RegisterServlet.java, and web.xml files in the project folder.
Configure Tomcat in VS Code:

Open the command palette in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS).
Type "Tomcat: Add Tomcat Server" and select the option to add a new Tomcat server.
Browse to the TOMCAT_HOME directory you extracted earlier and select it.
Create Launch Configuration:

Open the launch.json file in VS Code by clicking on the "Run and Debug" icon in the Activity Bar on the side and then clicking on the gear icon to create a launch configuration.
Choose "Java: Tomcat" from the list of configurations.
Configure Launch Configuration:

Modify the launch configuration to point to your web application context path and set the WAR file name (The context path should match the name of your project folder).

Build and Run the Application:

In VS Code, go to the "Run and Debug" view, select the launch configuration you created, and click the green "Run" button to build and run your application on the Tomcat server.
Access the Application:

Once the server is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/your-app-context where your-app-context is the context path of your web application (e.g., if your project is named PatientProject, the context path will be /PatientProject).
That's it! Now you should have your Java web application up and running using Apache Tomcat in Visual Studio Code. Remember to modify the RegisterServlet.java to include your actual email sending logic in a real-world scenario.
